 * A promoted item signifies a work queue item that has been promoted from 'pending' to 'executing'.
 * It also holds a list of all other identical work items that have threads polling on them for the execution to finish.
 * The duplicates were collected during the change in state and have been deleted from the pending items queue so that
 * no duplicates remain when calculation of the item has started.
 *
 * At the end of the execution notifyAll() is called on each item in the 'polled' list.
